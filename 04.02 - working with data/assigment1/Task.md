# Array Order Methods 

1. Write a function that takes the array of contacts and returns a new array sorted by last name. 
2. Write a function to return the array of contacts in reverse order. Do not use the built-in reverse() method. 
3. Write a function that returns the first 5 contacts from the sorted list (by last name). 
4. Create a function that returns an array of all unique first names. No duplicates should be present. 
5. Write a function that concatenates the first and last name of each contact into a new array of full names.

# Looping Through Arrays 

1. Write a loop that iterates through the array and logs each contact's email to the console. 
2. Write a function that takes an ID as a parameter and returns the contact with that ID. 
3. Create a function that counts how many contacts are from a specific country. The country should be a parameter of the function. 
4. Write a function that returns a new array of contacts that are within a given age range, e.g., 25 to 35 years old.


# Small App Assignment: Contact Search Tool

## Build a small web application that allows users to search for contacts by name or phone number.

Create a simple HTML page with an input field and a submit button.
- Implement a function to handle the submit event.
- Determine if the input is a string (name) or a number (phone number).
- Based on the input type, search the contacts array:
- - If it's a string, filter contacts whose first or last name contains the string. Consider case sensitivity.
- - If it's a number, find contacts whose phone number matches.
- - Display the matching contacts below the input field. 
You can list their names and phone numbers as a simple unordered list in HTML. 
Add styling to improve the layout.
